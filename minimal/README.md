## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Pre-configured Apollo Client:** The project comes with a preconfigured setup for Apollo Client
- **Simple Hello World example:** Where it either returns `Hello <name>!` if name argument is provided or else it returns `Hello World!`

You can more learn about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

You need to be on `node>=8` version for these boilerpates to work.

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `react-fullstack-minimal` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate react-fullstack-minimal

# 2. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 3. Navigate into the `server` directory of the new project
cd my-app/server

# 4. Start the server
yarn start # runs server on http://localhost:4000, and opens GraphQL PLayground

# 5. Open a new tab in the terminal and navigate back into my-app;
# then run the app
cd ..
yarn start
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` inside server starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn start` in the root directory will start GraphQL client on `http://localhost:3000`
